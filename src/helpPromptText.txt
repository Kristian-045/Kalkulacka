Thank you for choosing our calculator!! Now we will teach you all you need to know about it!
The calculator works on PEMDAS basis. You can also use parentheses to specify the priority of
an expression. The calculator offers a wide variety of functions such as addition, subtraction,
division, multiplication, modulo, factorial, roots and exponents. The only function with which 
syntax you might need help is root. You can specify a degree of a root as such: 3âˆš8. If you don't
specify the degree it defaults to the 2nd root.
